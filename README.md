Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Projects
Description / Overview

This repository contains projects that perform data transformation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling using Python and Pandas. The projects include:

Retail sales trend analysis
Student performance scoring
Pharmaceutical sales performance analysis
Each project demonstrates real-world data handling, aggregation, and predictive modeling techniques.

Data Description
storesales.csv → Monthly sales data for multiple stores and products.
stdscores.csv → Student performance data including quizzes, midterm, final exams, and projects.
regdata.csv → Regression dataset with multiple input features (X1–X5) and target variable 
sales_data.csv, zip_to_territory.csv, territory_targets.csv → Pharmaceutical sales and territory-level targets for performance analysis.

Business Context / Objective
Analyze store sales trends to identify high-performing products and patterns.
Compute final weighted scores to evaluate top students in a batch.
Estimate model coefficients using linear regression to predict outcomes.
Evaluate territory and district sales performance to guide strategic business decisions in pharmaceutical sales.

Technologies / Libraries
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook

Usage / How to Run
Download or clone this repository.
Ensure the datasets in the additional_files/ folder are in the same directory as the notebooks.
Open each .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells sequentially.



Q3_Linear_Regression.ipynb → Closed-form solution for model coefficients.

Pharma_Sales_Performance.ipynb → Territory and district-level sales analysis including attainment and contribution.
